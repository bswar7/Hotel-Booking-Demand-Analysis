# Hotel-Booking-Demand-Analysis

## City Hotel (Lisbon) vs Resort Hotel (Algarve)

# Project Overview

This project analyzes 119,390 hotel bookings collected from two real hotels in Portugal:

A City Hotel located in Lisbon

A Resort Hotel located in the Algarve region

The dataset, extracted from internal PMS systems between 2015–2017, provides insights into guest behavior, booking patterns, pricing trends, and cancellation drivers.

The goal is to understand what affects cancellations, how booking behavior changes between hotel types, and how hotels can improve pricing, operations, and revenue stability.
